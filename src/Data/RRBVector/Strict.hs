The @'Vector' a@ type is an RRB-Vector of elements of type @a@.

This module should be imported qualified, to avoid name clashes with the "Prelude".

= Performance

The worst case running time complexities are given, with \(n\) referring to the number of elements in the vector
(or \(n_1\), \(n_2\), etc. for multiple vectors). Note that all logarithms are base 16,
so the constant factor for \(O(\log n)\) operations is quite small.

= Implementation

The implementation uses Relaxed-Radix-Balanced trees, as described by

* Nicolas Stucki, [\"Turning Relaxed Radix Balanced Vector from Theory into Practice for Scala Collections\"](https://github.com/nicolasstucki/scala-rrb-vector/blob/master/documents/Master%20Thesis%20-%20Nicolas%20Stucki%20-%20Turning%20Relaxed%20Radix%20Balanced%20Vector%20from%20Theory%20into%20Practice%20for%20Scala%20Collections.pdf), January 2015.

Currently, a branching factor of 16 is used. The tree is strict in its spine, but lazy in its elements.
